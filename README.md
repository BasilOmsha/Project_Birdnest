- Persist the pilot information for 10 minutes since their drone was last seen by the equipment
- Display the closest confirmed distance to the nest
- Contain the pilot name, email address and phone number
- Immediately show the information from the last 10 minutes to anyone opening the application
- Not require the user to manually refresh the view to see up-to-date information
